# JingCodeGuy Media Toolbox
It is a plugin trying to supplement the missing tools in WordPress based on personal using experience.
- Since I am hosting in Siteground and using its Speed Optimizer plugin to optimize the website. The WEBP generator coming with it somehow have problem sometimes. For example, when I choose the compression level for individual media from "Medium" to "High". The thumbnails are deleted and regenerated but the webp version did not regenerate sometimes by observation and need to do a manual regeneration. So a manual regeneration feature coming to the mind for creation of this plugin.
