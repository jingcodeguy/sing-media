- Then during the optimization process, I found that jpeg compression is sometimes better than the generated thumbnail version. So I would like to add the following logic to the plugin
	- Compare the generated webp to the original thumbnail, remove automatically if bigger than it.
	- Add a compare action link for individual thumbnail comparison.
	- Add the comparison to the bulk action selection box for thumbnail comparison.
